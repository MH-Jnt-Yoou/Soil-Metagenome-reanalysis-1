# Soil-Metagenome-reanalysis

QIIME2 Pipe

This pipe is written based on our works. I standardized the command so if you want to use this pipe, be aware that the version of QIIME2 I used is 2018.06. 
I used both dada2 and deblur depending on the states of 16S sequence files and you can choose either on the process of pipe.

AND Please double check the path for your reference like SILVA or Greengenes!





OTU data of each project

All OTU data of project I used for reanalysis are uploaded in "Data" directory. 
Each filed are named after its project name and information of its project is presented on Table S12.




Thank you
